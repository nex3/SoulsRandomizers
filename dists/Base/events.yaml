  Comment: Old dragon behavior (summoning and AI speffects) and death. After 10 respawns have happened, dragons will respawn with speffect 3530030 and different dispmasks, meaning they do not damage the main health bar dragon (2500810). This also sets an event flag per enemy but it doesn't seem to do anything. Try to make this more complicated by behaving vanilla only when there are dragons there.

  Comment: Sets event flag 12505875 used to prompt Old Dragon AI for summoning animation, and for tree dragon to allow spawning on subsequent times. When at least one old dragon has been killed (12505828 >= 1), and not yet second phase (12505881), wait for either 12505875 to be unset and end (to avoid race condition?) or 12505876 to be set (when any Old Dragon gets summon speffect), play warning sound, and set 12505877 (which is also used by AI for the Old Dragons to hold their wands high in the air). Finally wait for 12505875 to be unset by tree dragon summon.

  Comment: Set 12505876 (prepare for tree dragons to spawn and play sound effect) when any Old Dragons get speffect 5025, set by the summon animation (3015). Although they could be summoned constantly, keep this vanilla and give the Tree Dragons time to move, requiring some Old Dragons to still be present.
