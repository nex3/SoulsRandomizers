Welcome to the directory of presets.

This is an attempt to make many of the tools that have been helpful for developing the mod
accessible to players, for the purpose of making challenge runs, resets, and showcases. You
can start making your own preset by copying Template.txt and renaming the file to whatever
you want your preset to be called.

You should also look at other text files in this directory to see how other presets are done.

Every time you open the preset selection window, it scans the directory for all text files.
Every time you select a preset from the dropdown, it tries to load it, giving an error if it can't.

There are two main ways to change enemy randomization: setting up custom pools, and
individual enemy assignments. "Oops All" mode sets all pools to one specific enemy
or type of enemy. Pool assignment generally respects progression and randomization
options. Individual enemy assignment overrides pools, and will usually ignore progression
and randomization options. Many of these modifications will generally completely change
a seed from what it was before.

To select a specific enemy, use its unique id, or use a name describing it followed by its id.
Names you can use are listed below.

Item randomization support is currently rudimentary, but it allows you to place key items
in specific areas (not yet specific locations) as defined in the item config in annotations.txt.
Item assignments may be better documented and supported in the future.
